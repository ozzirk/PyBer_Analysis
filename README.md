# PyBer_Analysis
**Overview of the analysis**

The purpose of this analysis was to look at ride sharing data over various time periods and different city types. In order to achieve this, original data was resampled and sorted. It was later plotted on a line graph to enhance readability. 
    

**Results**

There were some interesting findings from the ride sharing data. It is clear that ride counts and total fares were positively correlated. Through from rural to suburban to urban areas, both the number of rides and cost of rides increased. Drivers increased in a similar pattern. 

Some inverse relationships that were spotted include the actual cost of each fare vs. the popularity of ride sharing services. From rural to suburban to urban, demand increased, however, the average fare decreased. The same pattern follows for the average fare per driver when crossing the different location types.

**Summary**

  From our findings, we can make the following recommendations:
  1. A followup study should be conducted to include the amount of requests that did not complete. This would help us to determine if cost per ride may be a deterrent in rural settings and causing missed business opportunities
  2. A slight increase in prices for the urban market can be tested, since there is already an established network of drivers and demand
  3. The number of drivers far outweighs the demand for rides in the Urban area. Perhaps capping this number will allow existing drivers to have more satisfaction with the service as they will be paid more.
